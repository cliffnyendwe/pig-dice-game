            <ul>
                <li>Select a banker. If more than one player wants to start as the banker, have them roll dice. The
                    highest roller is the banker for the first round. The banker has slightly better odds of winning,
                    but puts up a larger stake.</li>
                <li>Set the stake. The banker puts up a bet of any amount. If you like, your group can decide on a
                    minimum stake.</li>
                <li>Match the stake. Each other dice player gets a chance to match some or all of the stake.</li>
                <li>Roll for an automatic win or loss. Once all bets are made, the banker rolls three dice. I</li>
                <li>Find the score for other results. If the banker didn't roll one of the combinations above, the
                    round continues. Find the banker's score:</li>
                <li>Try to beat the banker's score. If the banker rolled a score (not an automatic win or loss), each
                    player gets a chance to roll three dice to try and beat it. This uses the same scoring rules, but
                    only affects that player's stake:</li>
                <li>Start the next round. Once each player has rolled (or the banker rolled an automatic result), the
                    round is over</li>
            </ul>
